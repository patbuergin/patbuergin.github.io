This is something I wanted to start for a long time, and the pandemic has given me the push I needed to take the first step.

I envision this to be a place for sharing thoughts on software engineering, leadership, and other topics on my mind. A place to invite feedback and deepen my own understanding. A place that creates value not only for myself, but for you as well.
